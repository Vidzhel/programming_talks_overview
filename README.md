# Programming talks overview

From time to time, I enjoy watching talks on programming topics and sometimes I
encounter real gems that will definitely inspire somebody else apart from me. I
was dreaming of sharing juicy overviews of interesting talks a long time ago
and have already collected a bunch of videos in [my playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJRhuqXHXswxDLwneCeLtbSYVkyhCa4Ve). I
hope this structured source of information will inspire you.
