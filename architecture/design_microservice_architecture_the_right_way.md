## Misconceptions [3:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=3m30s)

- Micro Services enable our teams to choose the best programming languages and
frameworks for their tasks **Reality:** We'll demonstrate just how expensive
this is. Team size and investment are critical inputs.
- Code Generation is Evil **Reality:** What's important is creating a defined
schema that is Imo/o trusted.
- The Event Must be the Source Of Truth **Reality:** Events are critical parts of an
interface. But it's okay for services to be the system of record for their
resources.
- Developers can maintain no more than 3 services each **Reality:** Wrong metric;
we'll demonstrate where automation shines. Flow developers today each maintain
~5 services Weekly maintenance <5% of time

## API

- Store resource definitions as schemes independent of code [7:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=435s)
- Define operations that are available upon resources [8:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=8m33s)
- Store your schemes in a separate repository so that they can be shared across all microservices [8:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=8m59s)
- Use linters to validate your schema and make it consistent [9:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=9m36s)
- Control how you break APIs [10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=10m20s)
- Specification is the first class, so **don't duplicate it** [11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=11m50s), also code generated routes (consistent get, post routes), clients (you only pass resource, see the first point), mock clients

## Database

- No other service can communicate directly with another service db [17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=17m25s)
- Example of custom CLI that creates db in AWS [18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=18m24s)
- Define storage requirements (models and tables) in schemas [19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=19m29s)
- Code generation for tables, models and data access layer [20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=20m16s)
- Automated tests [22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=22m55s)

## Continuous Delivery [24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=24m16s)

- Microservice infrastructure - keep it simple [27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=27m5s)

## Events [28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=28m45s)

- Again, define event schemas separately [29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=28m34s)
- Producers - apart from updating local datastore, they save operations to
journal table, from which events are then transferred to message broker [31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=31m37s)
- Consumers - store fetched events in local db and process in small batches [32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=32m41s)
- Schema first events [34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=34m2s) 
- Lint your schema [35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=35m19s)
- Producers: Database Journal [36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=36m12s)
- Producers: Streams [37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=37m4s)
- Producing an Event [37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=37m57s)
- Producers: Testing [38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=38m55s)
- Consumers: Processing Incoming Events [39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=39m35s)
- Consumers: Testing [39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=39m56s)

## Dependencies

- Dependencies - Keeping things up to date [40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=40m35s)
- Dependencies Goal: Automatically update [41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=41m2s)
- Dependencies: Tracking [42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=42m)
- Dependencies: Updating [43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=43m4s)
- Dependencies & Continuous Delivery [43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6ow-UemzBc&t=43m41s)
